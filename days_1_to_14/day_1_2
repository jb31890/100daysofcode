# BMI calc

height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

# bmi = weight / height** , answer printed as a whole number(int)

bmi = (float(weight) / float(height)**2)
print(int(bmi))

# day 2 tip calculator
print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
total = float(input("What was the total bill?"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?"))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))
per_person = "{:.2f}".format(round((total + (total * tip/100)) / people, 2))
print(f"Each person should pay: ${per_person}")
